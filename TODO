- Reorganize code
  - Move code from tx.client and tx.server into better module name
  - Reorganize to group by API (for when SAM is added)
- Work out how BOB will not choose conflicting in/outports
  - No state can be stored between endpoint instances?
  - List all existing tunnels, pick a port that is not one of them?
  - Hard-coded start port, pick consecutive, use BOB list to 'count' offset?
- Write wrapper factories for clientFactory and serverFactory
  - clientFactory: Send dest before client can send data
  - serverFactory: Strip and save remote client dest before server uses data
  - Override getHost()/getPeer() somewhere to provide I2P Destinations
  - In stopFactory() launch another bobEndpoint to take down tunnel
    - Write new BOB Factory to take down arbitrary tunnel
