- Reorganize code to group by API (for when SAM is added)
  - Split grammar?

- Work out how state can be stored between endpoint instances

- Override getHost()/getPeer() somewhere to provide I2P Destinations

- Handle more errors properly

- Only run BOB tunnel creation Protocol for first Protocol created by the
  Factory, shortcut the process for subsequent Protocols.
  - Does this matter? Will a Factory ever have multiple Protocols at once?
  - For clients, the tunnel dies with the first Protocol

- Examine design, decide where I2P tunnels should be created and removed
  - Client and server tunnels are created by the endpoint
    - Once the tunnel is created, the real Protocol/ListeningPort is created
      and returned via a Deferred callback chain
    - Should the tunnels be created by the Protocol/ListeningPort instead?
  - Client tunnels are removed by I2PClientTunnelProtocol.connectionLost()
  - Server tunnels are removed by I2PListeningPort.stopListening()
